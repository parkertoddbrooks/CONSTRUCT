## üéØ Learning Path

### For Beginners
1. Start with [What is Construct?](concepts/what-is-construct.md)
2. Follow the [Quick Start](guides/quick-start.md)
3. Read [Trust The Process](concepts/trust-the-process.md)
4. Try [Your First Feature](guides/first-feature.md)

### For Experienced Developers
1. Jump to [Commands](tools/commands.md)
2. Review [MVVM with Swift 6](architecture/mvvm-swift6.md)
3. Understand [The Pentagram Construct](concepts/pentagram-construct.md)
4. Explore [Performance Patterns](practices/performance.md)

### For Teams
1. Read [Installation](guides/installation.md) for team setup
2. Review [Git Hooks](tools/git-hooks.md) for enforcement
3. Study [Code Organization](practices/code-organization.md)
4. Share [Trust The Process](concepts/trust-the-process.md)

## üîë Key Concepts

### The Pentagram Construct
Five interconnected points that make good architecture inevitable:
1. **Vision** - PRDs guide development
2. **Memory** - Context never lost
3. **Prediction** - Reuse over recreation
4. **Protection** - Quality gates enforce standards
5. **Learning** - System evolves with your code

### Self-Enforcing Architecture
- Git hooks prevent bad commits
- Patterns are enforced, not suggested
- Documentation updates automatically
- AI understands your architecture

### Trust The Process
When you trust the process, the process protects your code. Let go of manual enforcement and focus on building.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Reference

### Essential Commands
```bash
construct-update    # Update CLAUDE.md
construct-check     # Check architecture
construct-before    # Pre-coding check
construct-new       # Create from template
construct-session   # Save context
```

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# Morning
construct-update

# Before coding
construct-before FeatureName

# Create feature
construct-new FeatureName

# Before commit
git commit  # Hooks run automatically

# End of session
construct-session  # If context ~90%
```

## üìñ Extended Topics

### Advanced Usage
- [Custom Templates](advanced/custom-templates.md)
- [CI/CD Integration](advanced/ci-cd.md)
- [Team Workflows](advanced/team-workflows.md)
- [Metrics & Reporting](advanced/metrics.md)

### Troubleshooting

## üéì Philosophy

Construct isn't just tools and templates. It's a philosophy that good architecture should be inevitable, not aspirational. When you can't write bad code, you write good code. When good patterns are enforced, they become habits. When habits are automated, they become culture.

**Trust The Process. The Process Protects.**

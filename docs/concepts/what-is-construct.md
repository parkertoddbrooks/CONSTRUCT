# What is Construct?

## The Problem

Every Swift project starts with good intentions:
- "We'll use MVVM this time"
- "No hardcoded values"
- "Proper separation of concerns"
- "We'll maintain documentation"

But reality hits:
- Architecture drifts over time
- AI assistants suggest anti-patterns
- Documentation becomes stale
- Code reviews catch issues too late
- Context is lost between coding sessions

## The Solution: Construct

Construct is an AI-powered architecture system that makes good code inevitable. It's not just another template - it's a living system that actively prevents architecture drift and maintains code quality automatically.

## How It Works

Construct is built on the **Pentagram Construct** - five interconnected points that create a self-reinforcing system:

```
           Vision
             ⭐
           /   \

     ⭐---------------⭐
Protection
```

### 1. Vision (PRDs)
- Product requirements drive architecture
- AI understands what you're building and why
- Sprint goals stay visible in CLAUDE.md
- Can't accidentally build the wrong thing

### 2. Memory (Documentation)
- CLAUDE.md updates automatically with project state
- Never loses context between sessions
- AI always knows your patterns and decisions
- Documentation that's always current

### 3. Prediction (Pre-code Guidance)
- Shows what already exists before creating
- Suggests reusable components
- Prevents duplicate code
- AI knows your codebase structure

### 4. Protection (Enforcement)
- Git hooks prevent bad commits
- Architecture violations caught immediately
- Quality gates enforced automatically
- Can't merge code that breaks patterns

### 5. Learning (Monitoring)
- Extracts patterns from your actual code
- Tracks violations over time
- Evolves with your codebase
- Gets smarter as you build

## Key Principles

### Trust The Process
When you follow Construct's process, good architecture becomes inevitable. The system guides you toward the right patterns and prevents the wrong ones.

### AI-Native Development
Built for how developers actually work in 2025 - with AI assistants. Construct ensures your AI tools understand your architecture and suggest the right patterns.

### Zero Manual Maintenance
Everything updates automatically. No stale documentation. No manual rule files. The system maintains itself.

### Progressive Enhancement
Start simple, reveal complexity as needed. Construct grows with your project without overwhelming beginners.

## What Makes Construct Different?

### vs. Static Templates
- **Static**: Good on day 1, drift by day 30
- **Construct**: Actively prevents drift, stays good forever

### vs. Linters
- **Linters**: Find problems after they're written
- **Construct**: Prevents problems from being written

### vs. Documentation
- **Documentation**: Goes stale, requires maintenance
- **Construct**: Self-updating, always current

### vs. Code Reviews
- **Reviews**: Catch issues after the fact
- **Construct**: Prevents issues at commit time

## Who Is It For?

### Individual Developers
- Start with professional architecture
- Never lose context between sessions
- AI that understands your patterns

### Teams
- Consistent architecture across all developers
- Onboard new members instantly
- Shared patterns and standards

### Agencies
- Standardize across client projects
- Faster project starts
- Maintainable handoffs

## The Philosophy

Good architecture shouldn't require constant vigilance. It should be the path of least resistance. Construct makes the right way the easy way.

When you can't write bad code, you write good code. When good patterns are enforced, they become habits. When habits are automated, they become culture.

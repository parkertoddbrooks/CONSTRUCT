# Construct

Self-enforcing architecture for Swift projects. Build with confidence knowing your code quality is protected by automated enforcement and AI-native development patterns.

## What is Construct?

A Swift project foundation that prevents architecture drift through the **Pentagram Construct** - five integrated systems that make good code inevitable:

1. **Vision** - Product requirements drive architecture
2. **Memory** - Continuous documentation stays current
3. **Prediction** - Discover existing patterns before building
4. **Protection** - Git hooks enforce standards automatically
5. **Learning** - Architecture evolves with your codebase

## Key Features

### üèóÔ∏è Production-Ready Template
- MVVM architecture with Swift 6 concurrency
- Token-based responsive design system
- Professional UI patterns (no background flashing)
- Accessibility and testing built-in
- Three complete example features

### ü§ñ AI-Native Development
- Works with Claude
- Prevents AI from suggesting anti-patterns
- Context preserved across sessions
- Export rules to any AI platform
- Architecture guidance in every file

### üõ°Ô∏è Automated Enforcement
- Pre-commit hooks block bad code
- 11 quality gates run automatically
- No hardcoded values allowed
- Business logic stays out of Views
- PRD compliance verified

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup in 2 minutes
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/construct.git MyApp
cd MyApp
./setup.sh

# Start developing
construct check              # Verify architecture
construct new LoginFeature   # Create from template
git commit                   # Auto-enforcement runs
```

## Core Commands

```bash
construct check      # Architecture compliance
construct new        # Create features from templates
construct update     # Refresh documentation
construct export     # Generate AI platform rules
construct session    # Preserve context at 90%
```

## Why Construct?

**Without Construct:**
- Architecture degrades over time
- AI suggests anti-patterns
- Context lost between sessions
- Inconsistent code quality
- Manual enforcement fails

**With Construct:**
- Architecture self-enforces
- AI understands your patterns
- Context automatically preserved
- Quality gates prevent drift
- Standards applied uniformly

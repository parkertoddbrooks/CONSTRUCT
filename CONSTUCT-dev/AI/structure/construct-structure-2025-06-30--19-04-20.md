## Development Insights

### Current State
- CONSTRUCT development environment is 0% complete
- Infrastructure libraries are established (4 files)
- Configuration-driven validation is active (2 configs)

### Next Development Priorities
- [ ] Complete remaining 9 AI scripts
- [ ] Add more library functions for common operations
- [ ] Expand configuration-driven validation rules
- [ ] Create cross-environment analysis tools

### Architecture Quality
- [ ] Architecture validation not yet available
- [ ] Verify all scripts follow error handling patterns
- [ ] Ensure proper path resolution in all scripts
- [ ] Validate configuration file schemas

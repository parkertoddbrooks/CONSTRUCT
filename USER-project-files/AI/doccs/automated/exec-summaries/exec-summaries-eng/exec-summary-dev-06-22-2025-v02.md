# Executive Summary: Development Sessions 1-7
**Date**: June 22, 2025  
**Period**: Initial project setup through momentum scrolling implementation  
**Summary of**: devupdate-01.md through devupdate-07.md  

## Development Completed

Created SwiftUI-based iOS project with v5 architecture structure including Features, Shared, and Core modules. Extracted design system from prototype with color palette, typography, and spacing constants. Implemented MainView with waveform visualization, SPM display, play controls, and navigation to tools screen.

Built Canvas-based waveform rendering system that extracts real audio data using AVFoundation APIs. Waveform displays 50 samples per second at 5 bars per second on screen with configurable bar dimensions (4pt width, 4pt spacing, 0.5-90pt height range). Audio synchronization uses actual file duration (391s) instead of hardcoded values to match visual representation with playback position.

Implemented momentum-based scrolling with velocity tracking, realistic deceleration (0.95 decay rate), and bounds checking. Gesture system distinguishes tap vs drag behavior using 10pt movement threshold. Line and bubble animations synchronize through shared playheadAnimationOffset state with 0.25s spring contraction timing.

Added haptic feedback integration, debug logging throughout interaction flows, and timer-based animation at 0.016s intervals for 60fps performance. Created documentation system with dev update templates and comprehensive session logging.

## Technical Implementation

Architecture uses SwiftUI with Canvas for high-performance rendering. Audio processing via AVAudioFile and AVAudioPCMBuffer for waveform extraction. State management through @State properties with callback pattern for parent-child component communication. Gesture handling via DragGesture with velocity calculation and momentum physics simulation.

Momentum scrolling includes timer-based animation, gesture interruption handling, and silent momentum stopping to prevent visual flicker. Audio seeks to waveform position on momentum completion. All animations use spring curves for natural feel.

## Current Status

MainView functional with audio playback, waveform scrubbing, and momentum scrolling. Navigation structure established for 4-screen SMVP flow. ToolsView and ConnectWearableView remain unimplemented. Responsive design pending for multiple iPhone sizes. Debug logging requires cleanup before production.

## Outstanding Work

Implementation of remaining SMVP screens (Tools, Connect Wearable, Confirmation). Component extraction for SPMDisplayView and PlayButton. Responsive design conversion from hardcoded layout values. Debug logging removal. Integration planning for zplane SDK musical intelligence features.

 YES! You've just discovered the beauty of the system!

  As a Template User:

  You download → Get CONSTRUCT/ (actually CORE symlinked)
  You edit → Just build your app, no restrictions
  You commit → To YOUR repo, not CONSTRUCT's

  You're using CONSTRUCT, not developing it. The tools help you build your Swift app.

  If You Want to Contribute Back:

  Fork CONSTRUCT → Get CORE + LAB + TEMPLATES
  Work in LAB → Experiment safely
  Use promotion → Quality control locally
  Submit PR → Pre-validated changes to CORE

  The Key Protection:

  - Template users can't accidentally push to CONSTRUCT
  - Only people who fork the full system can contribute
  - Contributors must use LAB and promotion workflow
  - PRs only contain validated CORE changes

  This means:
  1. Users are protected - They can't break CONSTRUCT
  2. CONSTRUCT is protected - Random changes can't get in
  3. Quality is maintained - All changes go through LAB→promotion→PR
  4. Contributors learn - The workflow teaches the standards

  It's like:
  - Users get a car - Just drive it
  - Mechanics get the garage - With all the tools to improve the car
  - Can't accidentally ship a half-built engine to customers

  The separation between users and contributors is built into the architecture itself!

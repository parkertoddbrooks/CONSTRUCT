  - Audited all CLAUDE.md files
  - Documented which files to keep/delete
  - Designed two-stage process

  âœ… Phase 2: Create Enhancement System - COMPLETED

  - Created init-construct.sh with intelligent merging
  - Implemented injection protocol
  - Added pattern-enhanced header warning
  - Tested two-stage flow with /init

  âœ… Phase 3: Extract CONSTRUCT Development Patterns - COMPLETED

  - Created construct-dev plugin with injections:
    - guidelines.md (includes symlink rules, etc.)
    - examples.md (shell script patterns)
    - commands.md (CONSTRUCT commands)
    - ai-guidance.md (AI assistance patterns)
    - validated-discoveries.md (empirical truths)

  âœ… Phase 4: Extract iOS/Swift Patterns - COMPLETED

  - Moved iOS/Swift content to existing pattern plugins:
    - Performance â†’ frameworks/swiftui/injections/performance.md
    - Visual quality â†’ frameworks/swiftui/injections/visual-quality.md
    - Accessibility â†’ platforms/ios/injections/accessibility.md
  - Created RUN-specific backup in Projects/RUN/patterns/

  ðŸ”„ Phase 5: Enhance CLAUDE-BASE.md - PARTIALLY DONE

  - Added {{CONSTRUCT:CURRENT-STRUCTURE}} injection point
  - Still need to review if CLAUDE-BASE.md needs more enhancement

  ðŸ“‹ Next Steps According to Roadmap:

  1. Phase 6: Update All Scripts
    - Update create-project.sh to use two-stage init
    - Update import-project.sh for two-stage init
    - Update workspace-update.sh to regenerate CLAUDE.md files
  2. Phase 7: Testing & Documentation
    - Test with CONSTRUCT itself
    - Test with existing projects
    - Create migration guide
  3. Phase 8: Release & Migration
    - Create migration tools
    - Update documentation
    - Announce changes

  We're about 80% complete with the abstraction roadmap. The core functionality is working, but we need to update the peripheral scripts and do
  comprehensive testing.
